6. First PIA's progress review.


### Database #1

- This script must be written in CommonLisp
- Database of 25 contacts with 4 attributes (Besides the name, which is the PK).
- We need to be able to add, remove or print the db in console.
- We need to be able to save the DB to a file and load it aswell.


### Database #2

- This script must be written in CommonLisp
- List of 100 city names, each one of **one word** without _special characters_
- Requirements of the program:
  + Show all elements that contain the particle "as".
  + Show all elements that contains the letters "a", "r" and "s".
  + Show all elements that contains the particle "ca" or "za".


### Diameter of nth segment

- This script must be written in Haskell
- A segment is specified, then the diameter is calculating by using the _Fibonacci Sequence_ and the next formula:

### Determine the type of triangle

- This script must be written in Erlang
- User gives out the size of each of the triangle's sides and we will tell the type of the triangle based on the sizes.


## On-going Notes

- We can skip Erlang's compilation process by using [Erlang Scripts](http://erlang.org/doc/man/escript.html)
- We can also skip Haskell's compilation process by using [Haskell's runghc](http://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runghc.html)
